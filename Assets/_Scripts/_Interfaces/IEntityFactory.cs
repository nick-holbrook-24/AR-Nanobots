//The choice of using an interface (IEntityFactory) instead of an abstract base class
//(EntityFactoryBase) aligns well with the principles of SOLID design and offers several advantages.
//Here's a detailed explanation:

//Flexibility and Decoupling

//Flexibility:
//Interface: Interfaces provide a contract that any class can implement, allowing for greater
//flexibility in how the factory pattern is implemented. Different factories can implement the
//interface in their own unique ways without being constrained by the implementation details of
//a base class.
//Abstract Base Class: An abstract base class, while providing a shared implementation, also
//imposes a certain structure and behavior on all derived classes. This can limit flexibility,
//as all derived classes must inherit the same implementation.

//Decoupling:
//Interface: Using an interface promotes loose coupling between the components. The code that
//uses the factory relies only on the contract defined by the interface, not on any specific
//implementation. This makes it easier to swap out implementations without affecting the rest
//of the codebase.
//Abstract Base Class: While abstract base classes also promote decoupling, they can lead to
//tighter coupling if derived classes rely on shared behavior or state defined in the base class.

//SOLID Principles

//Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
//Interface: An interface ensures that each factory class has a single responsibility – to create
//entities as per the contract defined by the interface.
//Abstract Base Class: An abstract base class might inadvertently introduce additional
//responsibilities if it includes shared state or behavior, potentially violating SRP.

//Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
//Interface: Classes implementing the interface can be extended without modifying the interface
//itself, adhering to the OCP.
//Abstract Base Class: While you can extend an abstract base class, any change in the base class can
//affect all derived classes, which can be risky and might require modifications in multiple places.

//Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
//Interface: Any class that implements the interface can be used interchangeably, ensuring compliance
//with LSP.
//Abstract Base Class: Derived classes must conform to the base class's behavior. If the base class
//has complex behavior, it might be harder to ensure that all derived classes comply with LSP.

//Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
//Interface: Interfaces can be kept small and focused, ensuring that classes only implement what they
//need. This aligns well with ISP.
//Abstract Base Class: A base class might inadvertently include more functionality than needed by all
//derived classes, leading to a violation of ISP.

//Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
//Interface: High - level modules can depend on abstractions (interfaces), not on concrete
//implementations, which aligns perfectly with DIP.
//Abstract Base Class: While abstract base classes can also support DIP, they often include
//partial implementations, leading to a mix of abstraction and concrete behavior.

//Practical Considerations

//Ease of Testing:
//Interface: Interfaces are easier to mock in unit tests, allowing for more straightforward
//testing of components that depend on the factory.
//Abstract Base Class: Mocking abstract base classes can be more complex, especially if they
//include shared behavior.

//Simpler Implementation:
//Interface: Implementing an interface is straightforward and imposes no additional overhead.
//Abstract Base Class: Derived classes must consider the implementation and behavior of the
//base class, which can introduce complexity.

//Summary
//The choice of using an interface (IEntityFactory) over an abstract base class (EntityFactoryBase)
//is optimal because it promotes greater flexibility, decoupling, and adherence to SOLID principles.
//Interfaces provide a clean, contract-based approach that simplifies testing and maintenance,
//allowing different factories to be implemented independently and swapped out easily. This approach
//ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture for the AR application.
