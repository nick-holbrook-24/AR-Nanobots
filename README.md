AR Nanobots has been meticulously architected to adhere to SOLID principles, ensuring maintainable, scalable, and robust code. The core design revolves around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, with each component clearly separated and interacting seamlessly through well-defined interfaces and patterns.

**Model Layer**
The Model layer is represented by ScriptableObjects, which encapsulate the state and behavior of data entities. This approach leverages Unity's asset management system, making data management efficient and editor-friendly. To maintain a responsive and decoupled architecture, ScriptableObjects implement the Observer pattern. They notify their listeners in the View and Controller layers about data changes, ensuring real-time updates and synchronization.

**View Layer**
The View layer is designed to be independent of the data source, focusing solely on rendering the user interface and presenting data to the user. This separation ensures that the UI components are only responsible for displaying information and do not handle business logic. A dedicated script that observes changes in the Model and updates the UI accordingly, ensuring that the user interface reflects the current state of the application.

**Controller Layer**
The Controller layer manages the creation and initialization of game entities through various types of entity factories. The Level Design Manager oversees these factories to ensure that they create the right entities with the correct dependencies and initial states. Dependency Injection is used extensively to pass ScriptableObjects and other dependencies to the entities created by the factories. This practice promotes loose coupling and enhances testability and flexibility.

**Error Handling and Code Quality**
Assertions are used throughout the codebase to catch null references and other unexpected variables during development. These checks are enabled in the Unity Editor and Development builds, ensuring that issues are identified early. In Release builds, assertions are stripped out to optimize performance. An early exit coding strategy is employed where appropriate to minimize code indentation and complexity. This approach enhances code readability and maintainability by reducing nested conditional statements.

**Editor Scripts**
A single Editor script was created called LevelDesignManagerEditor, which customizes the Inspector Window of the Script. This script ensures that the monobehaviour script that's assigned to the entityFactory variable is of the type IEntityFactory; otherwise it shows an error and sets the variable back to null. This ensures only scripts that inherit the Interface IEntityFactory can be assigned to this variable.

**Additional Design Considerations**
The application relies on an event-driven architecture facilitated by the Observer pattern, ensuring that components remain loosely coupled and highly cohesive. The design adheres to SOLID principles.

**Conclusion**
Our AR application exemplifies a professional and well-organized approach to software design, adhering to SOLID principles and leveraging modern design patterns such as MVC and the Observer pattern. By focusing on separation of concerns, dependency injection, and robust error handling, we have created a maintainable and scalable codebase ready for future extensions and enhancements.
